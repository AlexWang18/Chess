## What I've learned:
This was my first personal project spurred on from binging Queen's Gambit. I dabbled a bit in Regex, design patterns, Maven and the general principles of OOP in this project. It has definitely ingrained into me some useful lessons. For one having a plan with your idea is key and drawing out a UML can be especially useful. Another is to only work on a problem one at a time and finish that thoroughly before moving on. I've definitely also learned the importance of having readable and formatted code as was a pain to try to parse through some of my spaghetti code. Frequently when debugging I found myself writing more code instead of getting rid of the faulty ones. I could have definitely done a lot more differently with the high level implementation and perhaps added a GUI but I am overall pleased with how it turned out.
